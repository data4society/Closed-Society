Monitor pressure on Russian NGOs.

In 2012 Russia's State Duma passed a law that would require almost any nongovernmental organization that receives any amount of foreign funding and engages in any activity authorities deem political to register as "foreign agents" – a term that's synonymous with "spy" in Russian – or face court sanctions, followed by involuntary closure.
  
This application monitors a wave of inspections of different non-commercial organizations across the country.
